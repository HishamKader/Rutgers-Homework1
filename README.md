Refractored code notes:

(html)
Line 30, 42 , and 54 class tags changed to "topics" cause a lot of different class tags
that could be made more simplified.

(css)
Line 97 set to "topics" and followed with "img" , and "h2" tags to identify
 HTML lines 43 to 66 with using less tags in css`

 Benefit-brand , benefit-lead and benfit-cost class tags changed to "benfit" to simplify
 the css code by removing their counterpart tags in css

 Summery Changes:
 Class tags being used more efficently.
 Simplified the "h1" tag for the name of the website and removed "span" tags
 Easier to read code.
